# AR-Gift-App
## Final Project for Dartmouth's CS65 Mobile Programming class. 

The ritual of gift-giving is a major part of modern culture and a key way in which we show affection to one another. 
As the Internet has proliferated, many forms of virtual gifts have been created (Spotify playlists, virtual gift-cards, home-videos), yet the process of giving a virtual gift currently lacks the intimacy and specialness that a physical gift provides. With our app, we seek to reclaim the joy that comes with receiving (and sending) a gift by recreating the experiences that come with physical gifts.

## What we learned

* Test early and test often! There are always more bugs to fix
* Some basic C#! And ARCore, Unity. Make sure to integrate early!
* Thereâ€™s always something someone wants to add or change. Limit yourself to a few things first, then work out from there
* Communication is key - make sure to report issues such as bugs in such a way that they will not be missed or skipped over!
* Buddy up when you debug; debugging alone is sad, find someone to talk through your bugs (especially with hidden edge/corner cases).
