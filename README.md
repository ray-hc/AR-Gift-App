A fun way to share virtual gifts.

##Installation & Testing
If you just want the APK, feel free to grab it off of https://ianmkim.com/joyshare.

## Special Notes
Please note that only certain phones support Google ARCore. You can find the full list of phones here https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices.  On devices that support ARCore, you also need ARCore plugin installed from google play services. You will see a popup to install ARCore plugin when you open the app. 

If your android device is not supported, you can simply press the "X" button in the Unity Scene after you open a gift.
